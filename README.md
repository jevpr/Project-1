## Project Overview

### Purpose:

The purpose of this project was to create an informative, easy-to-use website that detailed the history of women in technology.

I wanted the site to look professional, be clear and informative, but also be fun to use.

### Audience

My target audience was younger users, ideally girls 8 years +. As a result:

- The site needed an <em>accessible style</em> that would be appropriate for younger users. I took inspiration from the [BBC Bitesize website](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/topics/zx24xg8/articles/zprj7ty#zhrkjfr) layouts and [CGP Revision books](https://www.theworks.co.uk/dw/image/v2/BDXF_PRD/on/demandware.static/-/Sites-master-catalog-tws-uk/default/dwb3e29f89/9781782945598_1_Z.jpg?sw=400&sh=400&sm=fit).
- Content on the page needed to be kept <em>short</em>, to keep younger audiences engaged.
- Layout, colours, and formatting needed to be <em>fun and playful</em>.
  <br>
  builtByWomen\_ was designed to celebrate women programmers, developers, and builders in tech - like Ada Lovelace - with the hope to encourage future generations of women to feel more at home in the industry.

## Design

### Name

The initial working name for the site was 'womenInTech\_', but this always had to change because that site already exists. I wanted a name which emphasized the roles women played as founders and innovaters. So rather than 'women <b>in</b> tech,' I chose 'built <b>by</b> women'.

### Colour Palette

When considering color palette, I wanted to choose something that had a feminine feel to it. I wanted something a bit playful, that wasn't overly corporate. However, I wanted to avoid stereotypically 'feminine' colors like pink.

So, I chose the following color palette using the [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/) website.

### Balsamiq Wireframes

The following picture shows my initial mobile-first website design:

## Features

### Navigation Bar

The navigation bar is a drop down, fixed to the top of the screen so it's always available to help users navigate the site. The logo in the top left hand corner has been animated using JavaScript, so that it turns like a dial to reveal the menu. This design is playful and meant to recreate the feeling of physical mechanisms.

In future updates, I will play with having this logo in the top right hand corner - so it's more accesible for mobile users.

### Landing Page

The Landing page uses animation to engage the reader as soon as they visit the site. The two messages that pop up at the top of the screen (emulating WhatsApp messages), were designed to appeal to younger (Digital Native) users.

Below these two initial messages, you can see an overview of the websites profile pages. This section has been made responsive for difference screen sizes using Flexbox.

### Profiles

This was the most challenging page to make resopnsive, as it features a timeline detailing the history of each profilee.

### About and Contact

### Features Left to Implement

## Finished Project

### Responsive

The website is fully responsive for phones, tablets, laptops and desktops. Here, I have tested out the site's responsivity via <em>Am I responsive?</em> website:

For tests, I used [Am I Responsive?](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive?url=https://jevpr.github.io/Project-1/).

### Browser Friendly

The site has been tested for the following browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, Vivaldi, Brave, and Tor Browser.

For tests, I used [Browserling.com](https://www.browserling.com/browse/win10/safari5.1.5/https://jevpr.github.io/Project-1/).

### Accessibility

I checked accessibility by running my site through the Lighthouse tool on Google Dev tools.

### GiHub and Deployment

This website was linked with GitHub by <em>initalizing a respository</em> via Visual Studio Code. This created a new responsitory on my GitHub, where I could commit and sync changes I made on my local computer.

During this process, I had to type some commands into the console:

```
git init -b main

git config --global user.name "your-github-name"

git config --global user.email "your-email"
```

I deployed the website using GitHub's in built deployment featured, accessed through Settings > Pages for my Project 1 Respository.
