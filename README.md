# Bootcamp Project 1: <i>builtByWomen\_</i>

## Project Outline

### Purpose:

The purpose of this project was to create an informative, easy-to-use website that detailed the history of women in technology.

I wanted the site to look professional, be clear and informative, but also be fun to use.

The initial concept included a landing page, an about page, a contact page, and information pages on various women in the technical field throughout history.

There are also placeholder links for potential offshoot sites on the history of women in other STEM fields - like engineering or mathematics, for example.

## Design

### Name

The initial working name for the site was 'womenInTech\_', but this always had to change because that site already exists. I wanted a name which emphasized the roles women played as founders and innovaters. So rather than 'women <b>in</b> tech,' I chose 'built <b>by</b> women'.

### Color Palette

When considering color palette, I wanted to choose something that had a feminine feel to it. I wanted something a bit playful, that wasn't overly corporate. However, I wanted to avoid stereotypically 'feminine' colors like pink.

So, I chose the following color palette using the <a src="https://coolors.co/">coolors.co</a> website.
